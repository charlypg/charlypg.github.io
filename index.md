Hi ! My name is Charly Pecqueux--Guézénec, PhD student in computer science and ATER at ISIR, Sorbonne University, in Paris. 

I work on reinforcement learning (RL) for robotics, with a focus on safe exploration for robotics. My research draws on safe RL, distributional RL, and goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) to develop methods that can learn new skills in a safe way.
