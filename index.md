Hi ! My name is Charly Pecqueux--Guézénec (just call me Charly). 

I am a **robotics enthousiast** and currently a student at **ENS Paris-Saclay**, in France, in the Electrical Engineering department. 

This year, I am enrolled in the *M2 ATSI of Université Paris-Saclay* in which I study control and signal processing for research. 

**Warning :** The Website is not finished yet, so some personal projects are missing. 

## Research interests

- Control for robotics
- *Machine Learning* for robotic control
- Applied Mathematics 
- Signal processing

## Projects 

I have made several projects (*see [Projects](/projets/) page for more detail*). 

- Reinforcement learning methods for the control of a hexapod walker robot 
- Python Library to communicate with ABB Robots through RWS
