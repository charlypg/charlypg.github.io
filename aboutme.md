## Work Experience

### Research Internship: Stigmergy and Swarm Robotics

**Description:** The aim of the intership was to study the convergence of ant colony multi-agent swarms and
the properties veriﬁed by the distribution of agents and weights in the associated graph, such as the
existence of a path between the nest and food. A further objective was to determine the link between
the parameters of the system and its properties.

**Location:** *TU Delft, Netherlands*

**Period:** June-July 2020 (9 weeks) ; *during M1 EEA*

The internship had to be done in telecommuting due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Teaching Internship 

**Description:** It consisted in observing and teaching, in order to acquire teaching skills. Students were following a second semester of *electrical engineering and Industrial data processing*. Teachers performed *active learning*. 

**Location:** *IUT de Cachan, France*

**Period:** Sept-Dec 2020 ; *during M1 EEA*
