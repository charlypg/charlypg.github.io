## Brief Biography

I am a final year student at **ENS Paris-Saclay**, in the department of electrical engineering (EEA). 

I am currently pursuing the **ATSI master** degree of **Université Paris-Saclay** in the domains of *systems and control, signal and image processing*, in order to address *research topics* in these domains. 

Then I would like to continue with a *PhD* in the domain of *learning-based control for robotics*. 

In 2021, I passed the French ***Agrégation** de Sciences Industrielles de l'Ingénieur option Ingénierie Informatique (SII option II)*, which will allow me to teach in France : from computer science and Industrial data processing to control. 

During the year 2019-2020, I pursued a master degree in electrical engineering (*M1 E3A André Ampère*) at *ENS Paris-Saclay*, covering fields like embedded computing, signal processing, nonlinear control, electronics for telecommunications or power electronics. This year, I realised with a collegue a research project on *reinforcement learning methods for the control of a hexapod walker robot*. I have also realised a reasearch internship, in telecommuting with TU Delft, in the domain of *Swarm Robotics*. 

In 2018, I entered ENS Paris-Saclay in the *SAPHIRE multidisciplinary program* (Electrical, Mechanical & Civil Engineering), after three years of intensive preparation in mathematics and physics at *Lycée Saint-Louis* in Paris. The program covered various fields : 
applied mathematics, mecatronics, material sciences, quantum physics, computer science, etc.

- Reinforcement learning methods for the control of a hexapod walker robot
- Python Library to communicate with ABB Robots through RWS

## Work Experience

### Stigmergy and Swarm Robotics

**Research Internship**

**Description:** The aim of the intership was to study the convergence of ant colony multi-agent swarms and
the properties veriﬁed by the distribution of agents and weights in the associated graph, such as the
existence of a path between the nest and food. A further objective was to determine the link between
the parameters of the system and its properties.

**Location:** *TU Delft, Netherlands*

**Period:** June-July 2020 (9 weeks) ; *during M1 EEA*

The internship had to be done in telecommuting due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Teaching Internship 

**Description:** It consisted in observing and teaching, in order to acquire teaching skills. Students were following a second semester of *electrical engineering and Industrial data processing*. Teachers performed *active learning*. 

**Location:** *IUT de Cachan, France*

**Period:** Sept-Dec 2020 ; *during M1 EEA*
