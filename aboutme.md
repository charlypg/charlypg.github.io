## Projects

- Reinforcement learning methods for the control of a hexapod walker robot
- Python Library to communicate with ABB Robots through RWS

## Work Experience

### Stigmergy and Swarm Robotics

**Research Internship**

**Description:** The aim of the intership was to study the convergence of ant colony multi-agent swarms and
the properties veriﬁed by the distribution of agents and weights in the associated graph, such as the
existence of a path between the nest and food. A further objective was to determine the link between
the parameters of the system and its properties.

**Location:** *TU Delft, Netherlands*

**Period:** June-July 2020 (9 weeks) ; *during M1 EEA*

The internship had to be done in telecommuting due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Teaching Internship 

**Description:** It consisted in observing and teaching, in order to acquire teaching skills. Students were following a second semester of *electrical engineering and Industrial data processing*. Teachers performed *active learning*. 

**Location:** *IUT de Cachan, France*

**Period:** Sept-Dec 2020 ; *during M1 EEA*

## Education 

### École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay 

#### M2 ATSI



#### M2 INTRANET

Computer science, signal processing, control, electronics, telecom‐
munications

#### M1 EEA

Master degree in electrical engineering and industrial computer program‐
ming
• Fields : Embedded computing, control, optimisation, signal processing, elec‐
tronics for telecommunications and power electronics.
• Research : Learning Locomotion for a Hexapod Robot. This project implied
reinforcement learning, embedded computing, control and optimisation. The
goal was to make our robot learn a locomotion gait. It also lead to the imple‐
mentation of a functionnal simulator, using Gym & PyBullet.
• Internship : Stigmergy & Swarm Robotics, TU Delft, Netherlands
