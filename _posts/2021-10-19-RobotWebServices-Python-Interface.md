[RobotWebServices-Python-Interface](https://github.com/charlypg/RobotWebServices-Python-Interface) is a Python library which implements a Robot Web Services (RWS) client for ABB Robots in Python. 

The library provides an interface which allows the user to communicate with an ABB Robot thanks to Robot Web Services (RWS). 

Essentially, it allows to : 

- Communicate with a robot in HTTP 
- Follow the evolution of resources

The library facilitates the use of RWS. The user has not to manage directly HTTP requests and responses, or sockets. The user only needs to know the action and the data he wants to send to the robot.
